== Description ==

YouTube is back!

Having tested this using Firefox, Edge, Chrome on Windows 10 & Linux it works on all except for Chrome on Windows 10!

You can bypass this in Chrome by searching in the developer tools, locate the cookies, go to Tinychat.com, locate a cookie named "remember_random-number", and change the value for 'Same Site' to none and remove the tick for HttpOnly and add a tick in 'Secure',
This may only be affecting some users, Images on how to do this are now below.

You now have to register to use the chat, you can do that at <a href="https://tinychat.com"   rel="nofollow ugc"  >Tinychat</a> , I apologise about that.

You can now access dark mode! I've added screenshots on how to turn it on, I hope it helps.

This plugin is used for BuddyPress to add Tinychat video chat to Groups, so add https://tinychat.com and https://www.ruddernation.com to your whitelist,
This uses the Tinychat video chat using HTML5 WebRTC so this can be used on nearly all devices,
Once the plugin is installed, simply create a new group or choose an existing one, Selct 'manage then ' and enable, The chat allows users to display their camera/audio.
